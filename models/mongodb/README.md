# Project Name: Community Collaboration Platform

## Overview
This GitHub repository contains the Mongoose schemas for a Community Collaboration Platform, designed to facilitate communication, sharing, and interaction within communities. The schemas define the structure for activities, communities, forums, posts, tokens, and users, incorporating features like soft deletion, references, and timestamps to enhance functionality and data integrity.

## Files and Descriptions
- **activities.js**: Defines the schema for activities within communities, including details such as title, description, creator, and associated posts.
- **communities.js**: Specifies the schema for community entities, detailing attributes like name, description, members, and activities.
- **forum.js**: Outlines the schema for forum discussions, including topics, posts, and user engagement.
- **post.js**: Describes the schema for posts made by users in forums or activities, including content, authorship, and related comments.
- **token.js**: Manages the schema for authentication tokens, crucial for user authentication and session management.
- **users.js**: Defines the schema for user profiles, including information like username, password, email, and roles within the community.

## Installation
To use these schemas in your project, ensure you have Node.js and MongoDB installed, then clone this repository and install the necessary dependencies with:
```bash
npm install
```

## Usage
These schemas are designed to be integrated into a Node.js application using Mongoose for MongoDB interaction. Import the schemas into your application models and utilize them to create, read, update, and delete data related to community collaboration activities.

## Contribution
Contributions to improve the schemas or extend the functionality of the platform are welcome. Please submit pull requests with a clear description of changes and updates.
